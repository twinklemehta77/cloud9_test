# dextraction
An automated data processing tool for extracting and cleaning collected cassava and weather data.

**dextraction.js** creates an output of farming practices variables joined with corresponding weather data based on the last day of the week where pest and disease was observed, minus (N) number of days.

**csvcompare.js** compares the contents of (2) CSV files under the same column headers (which can be of any order) are identical, and writes to an output csv file the matching rows plus optional columns from the base csv file.

## Official Releases

The listed sources [here](https://github.com/ciatph/dextraction/releases) are released versions according to data format necessity. Please read each version's overview to get which source you will need.

- [version 3.0.0](https://github.com/ciatph/dextraction/releases/tag/v.3.0.0)

- [version 2.0.0](https://github.com/ciatph/dextraction/releases/tag/v.2.0.0)

- [version 1.0.0](https://github.com/ciatph/dextraction/releases/tag/v.1.0.0)

### Version Updates

**Version 4.0.0** was built from `version_1.0.0`. It was originally used for the 1st batch of cassava data extraction last July 2018, with a few modifications on the output columns. (Original) Output data sets for this version is available at [link](https://trello.com/c/9jHUFKpV). _(private trello board)_

- **[NEW]:** added `csvcompare.js`. Compares if the columns of (2) CSV files under the same column header are identical: all user-specified column content have identical counter parts in one another.

- added `appendWeatherDataBacktrack()`: iterates over and reads IRRI weather data files based on last day of the week where P&D was observed, down to the date minus (N) number of days. 

- updated `utils` with JS Date() utility methods
- draws the comparison of Isabela and IRRI's weather data using R's `gplot2` package.

- updates the firebase GPS records by matching ISU's updated GPS locations with farmer names file to their counterparts synced to firebase.

- extracts and appends IRRI weather data on the full month where P&D was observed to the original cassava data

4. Obtain the input data sets that will be used. Please refer to the `README's` in `/data/weather/` and `data/weather/graphr/` for data formatting and how to obtain them.
4. Start debugging using VS Code. Open and edit the following source codes and make sure they contain proper input file names and file paths: `app-dextraction.js`, `app-csvcompare.js`. Run `npm` commands from the commandline. 

   - To run **dextraction**, type the command <br>
     `node app-dextraction.js`, and `node index-csvcompare.js`
   - To run **csvcompare**, type the command <br>
     `node app-csvcompare.js`



## Web Tools

Web tools for 1) finding IRRI's weather data `cell id` using longitude and latitude, and 2) viewing graphs comparing cassava weather data (version 2.0's 30 and 60 days IRRI weather data) are available in `/webtools`.

1. Navigate using the command line to `/webtools`.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `gulp dev`.
